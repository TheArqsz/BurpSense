# Browse and Filter Issues

**Issues View Structure:**

BurpSense organizes issues in a three-level hierarchy for easy browsing:

1. **Severity Level** (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFORMATION)
2. **Issue Name** (with instance count, e.g. "SQL injection (3 instances)")
3. **Individual URLs** (each affected endpoint with short ID)

**Example:**
```
📁 HIGH
  ⚠️ SQL injection (3 instances)
    🔗 https://api.example.com/login [a9b2921d]
    🔗 https://api.example.com/search [f4e8c2a1]
    🔗 https://api.example.com/admin [b3c4d5e6]
  ⚠️ Cross-site scripting (reflected) (1 instance)
